A few good things to have on hand

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - A variety of free web fonts that are super easy to include in your project

[Iconify](https://iconify.design/) - One stop shop for free icons that are easy to include in your project

[Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/) - Super easy, low stakes online code editor for playing around with HTML/CSS and JS. Has an active community of people making really cool stuff. If you want a quick look at some examples, [*Free Frontend*](https://freefrontend.com/css-code-examples/) aggregates some really great codepen projects (beware the numerous ads, though)

[Glitch](https://glitch.com/) - Like Codepen, but even more robust (I actually use this as my the main IDE for all my web projects, 'cause you can set up an entire project with modules and packages and builds and everything without having to download a single thing. And it integrates nicely with Github)
